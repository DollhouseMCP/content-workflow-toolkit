## Platform Notes

### LinkedIn
- Native posts perform better than link shares
- Add link in first comment to avoid algorithm penalty
- Images increase engagement
- Best times: Tue-Thu, 8-10am or 12-1pm

### Blue Sky
- Growing developer community
- More conversational than LinkedIn
- Good for threads and discussions
- Custom feeds can boost visibility

### Mastodon
- Use relevant hashtags (they're how discovery works)
- Choose instance wisely (tech-focused recommended)
- Content warnings for long posts appreciated
- Boosts (retoots) matter more than likes

### Avoiding: Twitter/X
- Deliberately excluded from this workflow
- If needed for specific reach, can adapt Blue Sky format
